### Personal project | Mortgage loan elegibility prediction

>The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose information about mortgages.
>These public data are important because:
 *  + they help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of their communities.
    + help authourities to determine and fish out all predatory act of lending.
    + they give public officials information that helps them make decisions and policies.
    + They shed light on lending patterns that could be discriminatory.
Eg. a reported increase in mortgage borrowing by blacks and Hispanics as of 1993.

### Goal for this Notebook:
Show how to perform advanced Analytics and Machine Learning in Python using a full complement of PyData utilities. This is aimed for those looking to get into the field Data Science or those who are already in the field and looking to solve a real world project with python.

#### This Notebook will teach the following:
#### Data Handling
*   Importing Data with Pandas
*   Cleaning Data
*   Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib
*   Doing predictive Analysis with various Machine Learning Algorithms

#### Data Analysis/Machine Learning
*    Supervised Machine learning Techniques:
    +   RandomForestClassifier
    +   StratifiedKfold ( 5 folds)
    +   ETC
    

#### Valuation of the Analysis
*   K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally
*   Output the results from the IPython Notebook to Kaggle
#### Results obtained
* Was able to derive excerpt insights to give pro recommendation to borrowers
* Was able to predict applicant loan approval with *74%* accuracy
